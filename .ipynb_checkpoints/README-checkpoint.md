# AIdeator: a LLM Ideation partner

AIdeator is an intelligent brainstorming tool that leverages large language models to help users generate innovative, feasible, and profitable product ideas through collaborative human-AI ideation.

## Overview
Starting a new product or project can be challenging. AIdeator bridges the gap between raw problem statements and fully-formed product concepts by guiding you through a structured ideation process.
